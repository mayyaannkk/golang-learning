Writing a test is just like writing a function, with a few rules:

1. It needs to be in a file with a name like `xxx_test.go`
2. The test function must start with the word `Test`
3. The test function takes one argument only `t *testing.T`
4. In order to use the `*testing.T` type, you need to import "testing", like we did with fmt in the other file
